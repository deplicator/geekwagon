History
-------
### Prairie View A&M
**2011 - present**  
_Working towards Bachelors in Computer Science_  
Going back to school has increased my passion for computer science. I am 
fortunate to have the opportunity.
<!--<meter value="0.6508">earning bachelors</meter>-->

### Prairie View A&M Student Employee
**2014 - present**  
_Cloud Computing Research Group_  
Image processing on a hadoop cluster.

### L3 Communications
**Spring & Summer of 2013**  
_Software Development Internship_  
My first work as a developer was at the Johnson Space Center, not a bad start. I
helped write the gui for a program that tests the on board flight controller of
the Orion Multipurpose Manned Vehicle.

### Burgess Specialty Fabricating
**2010 - 2014**  
_Information Technology Administrator_  
Burgess Specialty builds custom sheet metal and machining projects for a variety
of industries. They were gracious enough to work with my school schedule, and
the experience has been unique. The first task was to upgrade all the client 
operating systems from Windows 2000 to Windows 7. We also made the move to
Google Apps and virtualized all the servers using VMWare products. I gained 
experience working with CNC machines and how they communicate (tcp/ip & rs232).
While there I supported different CAD programs, specifically AutoDesk. It was my
first time working with company that uses a custom ERP, and I created a new 
company website. Knowing my time with Burgess was temporary I created an 
extensive documentation wiki, over 400 pages, written for non-technical users.

### Lone Star College System
**2010 - 2011**  
_Associates of Business_  
I came to Lone Star with credits from five other colleges with the intent to
earn a degree in anything. My time at Sidtek gave me an interest in business,
and I found it enjoyable in the academic environment. I earned an Associates 
with a GPA of 4.0 (to be fair, transfers didn't count against me).

### Baytek International
**2008 - 2010**  
_Information Technology Manager_  
Baytek is a software development company and gave me my first experience as a
dedicated IT professional. It also introduced me to the world of development. 
While there I gained small business server administration experience. On 
occasion I even got a chance to work on some electronic side projects with the 
hardware developers. They had two locations, so I set up a distributed file 
system between them. This allowed users in both places quicker access without 
fumbling with VPN's and FTP's. I also created a custom archival backup solution.
Baytek used Watchguard Fireboxes, which was fun to learn about. I setup and used
an IT budget, migrated all their physical servers to virtual servers, and 
maintained the software licensing.

### Compumaster
**2008**  
_Lead Technician_  
Sidtek's phone number was forwarded to Compumaster when the computer repair 
department was closed. When I applied here they knew who I was because customers
were asking for me by name--very flattering. I was here for a short time, but in
that time I worked my way up to Lead Technician. What I enjoyed most was the 
opportunity to work with and learn from many talented coworkers.

### We the People
**2007 - 2008**  
_Writer_  
While working at Sidtek I was approached by a small local paper about writing
technology articles for a non-technical audience. It was a great way for me to
flesh out my thoughts on different aspects of technology and how people use it.
If anything it helped me articulate PC problems to my customers at Sidtek. One 
of my better articles was title "Backing up is Hard to Do".

### Sidtek, L.L.C.
**2003 - 2008**  
_Head Computer Repair Technician_  
Sidtek was my first civilian job after the Marine Corps. I was given a lot of
leeway from the owner and handled almost all of the PC repair department
activities. The most profound thing I learned about myself is that I enjoyed
solving computer problems, but I loved helping people. It was a very gratifying
position to be in. I worked there for almost six years, and in that time I
learned troubleshooting and diagnostics of hardware, software, clients, servers,
and networks.

### United States Marine Corps
**1998 - 2003**  
_Sergeant - Nuclear Biological Chemical Warfare Defense Specialist_  
In my youth I was not the brightest, but I had enough intuition to know I was
not ready for college. The job title is impressive, but most of my time was 
spent doing warehouse inventory management, office work, and teaching classes. 
The classes I taught pertained to survival in contaminated environments. As a 
Corporal and Sergeant I was lead other Marines in the office and in the field. 
While there I held a secret clearance, earned a Good Conduct Medal, and a 
National Defense Service Medal. I got out with an honorable discharge after a 
six month stop loss--making my total time on active duty four and a half years.

###Cypress Fairbanks High School
**1994 - 1998**  
_High School Diploma_  
Not much to say about high school, although I did get an award for helping 
others in wood shop. I took a lot of wood shop.
