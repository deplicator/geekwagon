History
-------
### Prairie View A&M
**Graduating May 2016**  
_3.9 GPA - Bachelors in Computer Science_  

While at Prairie View I've held a few student employment positions; currently
I'm working to create a web IDE for a cloud based image processor with the 
[Cloud Computing Research Group][1].


### L3 Communications
**Spring & Summer of 2013**  
_Software Development Internship_  

Wrote the web interface for software that tests the on-board computer of the 
[Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle][2]. Pretty exciting for my first real 
development job.

### Burgess Specialty Fabricating
**2010 - 2014**  
_Information Technology Administrator_  

Burgess Specialty builds custom sheet metal and machining projects for a 
variety of industries. They were gracious enough to work with my school 
schedule. While here I upgraded all the client operating systems from Windows 
2000 to Windows 7 (not a typo). We  also made the move to Google Apps and 
virtualized all the servers using VMWare products.  I gained experience working
with CNC machines and how they communicate (tcp/ip & rs232).  While there I 
supported several CAD programs, specifically AutoDesk. It was my first time 
working with company that uses a custom ERP, and I created a new company 
website. Knowing my time with Burgess was temporary I created an extensive 
documentation wiki, over 400 pages, written with non-technical users in mind.

### Lone Star College System
**2010 - 2011**  
_Associates of Business_  
I came to Lone Star with credits from five other colleges with the intent to
earn a degree in anything. My time at Sidtek gave me an interest in business,
and I earned an Associates of Business with a GPA of 4.0.

### Baytek International
**2008 - 2010**  
_Information Technology Manager_  
Baytek is a software development company and gave me my first experience as a
dedicated IT professional. It also introduced me to the world of development. 
While there I gained small business server administration experience. On 
occasion I got the chance to work with the hardware developers. Baytek had two
locations, so I set up a distributed file system between them. This allowed 
users in both places quicker access without fumbling with VPN's and FTP's. I 
also created a custom archival backup solution. Baytek used Watchguard 
Fireboxes, which was fun to learn about. I setup and used an IT budget, 
migrated all their physical servers to virtual servers, and maintained software
licenses.

### Compumaster
**2008**  
_Lead Technician_  
Sidtek's phone number was forwarded to Compumaster when the computer repair 
department closed. When I applied, Compumaster already knew who I was because 
customers asked for me by name--very flattering. I was here for a short time, 
but worked my way up to Lead Technician. I enjoyed the opportunity to work 
with and learn from many talented technicians.

### We the People
**2007 - 2008**  
_Writer_  
While working at Sidtek I was approached by a local paper about writing 
technology articles for a non-technical audience. It was a great way for me to
flesh out my thoughts on different aspects of technology and how people use 
it. If anything it helped me articulate PC problems to my customers at Sidtek.
One of my better favorite articles was "Backing up is Hard to Do".

### Sidtek, L.L.C.
**2003 - 2008**  
_Head Computer Repair Technician_  
Sidtek was my first civilian job after the Marine Corps. I was given a lot of
leeway from the owner and handled all of the PC repair department activities. 
The most profound lesson learned while working here is that I enjoy helping 
people more than fixing computer problems. It was a very gratifying
position to be in. I worked there for almost six years, and in that time I
learned troubleshooting and diagnostics of hardware, software, clients, 
servers, and networks. 

### United States Marine Corps
**1998 - 2003**  
_Sergeant - Nuclear Biological Chemical Warfare Defense Specialist_  
Fortunately I had enough intuition to know I was not ready for college. The 
job title is impressive, but most of the time was spent in warehouse inventory
 management, office work, and teaching. I trained Marines to survival in 
contaminated environments. As a Corporal and Sergeant I lead other Marines in 
the office and in the field. While there I held a secret clearance, earned a 
Good Conduct Medal, and a National Defense Service Medal. I was honorably 
discharged after a six month stop loss--bringing my time on active duty to 
four and a half years.

###Cypress Fairbanks High School
**1994 - 1998**  
_High School Diploma_  
Not much to say about high school, although I did get an award for helping 
others in wood shop. I took a lot of wood shop.
