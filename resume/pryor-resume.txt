Notable History
---------------
### Prairie View A&M
**Graduating May 2016**  
_3.9 GPA - Bachelors in Computer Science_  

While at Prairie View I've held a few student employment positions; currently
I'm working to create a web IDE for a cloud based image processor with the 
[Cloud Computing Research Group][1].
<pre><meter value="0.81755"></meter> <- earning bachelors 81.75%</pre>

### L3 Communications

Wrote the web interface for software that tests the on-board computer of the 
[Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle][2].

### Burgess Specialty Fabricating
**2010 - 2014**  
_Information Technology Administrator_  

Upgraded all clients and virtualized on site servers. As a fabrication shop 
they have a variety of CNC machines to network. Created an extensive internal
documentation wiki.

### Sidtek, L.L.C.
**2003 - 2008**  
_Head Computer Repair Technician_  

The most profound lesson learned while working here is that I enjoy helping 
people more than fixing computer problems.

### United States Marine Corps

_Sergeant - Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warfare Defense Specialist_  

After high school I wasn't ready for college and found myself in the service. 
Much of my time was spent with administrative work, warehouse management, and
teaching other Marines how to survive in contaminated environments.
