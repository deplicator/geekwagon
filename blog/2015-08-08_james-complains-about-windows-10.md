![Did something happen?][pic-1]

I promise not to say anything about Windows 10 privacy settings or having to pay for add-free
Solitaire. There are plenty of real tech sites for those complaints already.

I was very optimistic about Windows 10, and I was let down from the start (see picture). My top
complaint about Windows 10: **lack of straightforward documentation**. In fact most of the following
stems from this.

### Somethings to like

I don't want to be all negative, there are some likable features.

1. The only driver I had to go find was my printer. That's awesome.

2. Two finger touch pad scrolling (fun fact: this is the only thing I like about Mac).

3. You can resize the consoles width by clicking and dragging--what a crazy idea for an OS called
   Windows.

4. Best for last: **Snap to Corners!** I've had this in Lubuntu for years and feel sad when I drag a
   window to a corner on my Windows machine and it takes up half the screen instead of a quarter.


### How many installs of Windows does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?

#### TLDR version

Four OS installs later, my laptop is running a fresh install of Windows 10. I'll never claim
to be the smartest guy around, but I did do PC repair for six years, IT work for about eight years,
and I'm a fourth year computer science student. Why is it so hard for me to use Microsoft products?
(Stay tuned for James Complains about Visual Studios.)

#### Long version

_The First Install_: My laptop came with Windows 8 but has been running Lubuntu since 10 minutes
after purchase. I never wrote a post to complain about Windows 8 because as soon as I hit the
windows key I was done. All I wanted to do was search for a term while looking at a web browser and
Windows 8 failed so hard so fast I surprised.

My laptop has a legal copy of 8 (the Windows key is hard coded in the bios). I used [the
tool][link-1], downloaded Windows 10, got it on a USB drive, and installed 10 on my laptop. Skipped
the part with the key because they were so nice to put the key in the bios I can't look anywhere to
see it anyway. It didn't matter, I couldn't active Windows 10. It's not smart enough to read the
bios and see a key (does this mean the whole silly bios key storage is specific to 8?).

_The Second Install is Two Installs_: Next I scrounged for my Windows 8 USB drive from long ago on
the off chance I wanted to put Windows back on my laptop. To be fair had I looked harder I'd have
found the [FAQ that said to do that][link-2] (it's burred in there about 10 down, and the question
isn't how I would ask it).

Whatever, I got solid state now, and Windows 8 is running and activated in a few minutes. I let it
do the Windows 10 upgrade through Windows Update in the hopes it will be less problematic. As
expected it took quite some time to download and upgrade to Windows 10, but it did it.

I'm old fashion with this line of thought, but I prefer fresh installs over upgrades to an operating
system. Even though this is a fresh install then an immediate upgrade, it bothers me to have
`windows.old` on my hard drive--can't help but wonder what other crud is left over. I decided to go
ahead and play around with Windows 10 before I did that extra install. Turned out it saved me some
time.

_The Final Install_: The Windows 10 interface is not bad. I found a thing that said something to the
effect of "Hey sign in with your Microsoft Account and get these cool features". Now remember, I
want to drink the kool-aid here so I sign in and screwed myself. A few hours later, I restart the
laptop, only to find when it comes back up it asks for my Microsoft Account password to log back in.
What happened to my localaccount? It would have been nice if somewhere it had said, "Oh by the
way... when you restart you need to sign in with a different password." Maybe it did say that, but
it was not prominent.

_The Last Straw_: For most users, this may not be a big deal. I use a password manager and don't
know my Microsoft Account password. I can't log in to open my password manager. I could reset the
password from another computer, but I decided it was time for that fresh install of Windows 10.


### Bonus: James Also Complains about Microsoft Edge

I was excited to hear Microsoft was making a new browser from the ground up. In fact this is the
number one reason for me to try Windows 10. Two things I didn't like about it, and one of them made
me set Chrome as default right after it happed.

1. The address bar is invisible for some reason. Maybe this is cool to some people, but I'm kind of
   simple and like to know where to click on to go to a website.

2.  You cannot open local html files without hassle. It shouldn't take more than a right click and
   "Open with.." for an html file. After watching Edge struggle with `file:///C:/afile.html` for
   over a minute, I was in Chrome for the rest of my life. So much for new Microsoft browsers.
   (note: There [is a way to open local html files in Edge][link-3] but no one has time for that.)


### Second Bonus: James is [Meh][link-4] about these features

1. Flat UI with square corner.

2. Cortana--althought I could complain about needed a Microsoft Account to try it.
