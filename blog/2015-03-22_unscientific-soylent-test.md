![Powdered Food][picture-1]

Over spring break I decided to give Soylent a try. If you haven't heard of it [check out this link
to learn more][link-1]. My original plan was to give it a solid scientific method-ing (could I be
the first person to use "scientific method" as a verb?), but either because I'm busy, lazy, or a
realist I opted for a simple approach.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Almost six months ago I ordered a week supply of Soylent. Version 1.4 is what arrived; which is nice
because they ditched the little bottle of fish oil. Only powder from here on out. For the first
batch I followed the instructions to the letter. Pour a whole package in the container they sent,
added some water, shake the hell out of it, then added more water. By the second round of shaking I
knew future batches were going in the blender. When I opened the bottle to check consistency it
smelled horrible. Absolutely horrible. Had I wasted my money?

It is supposed to be refrigerated for at least two hours, but I let it sit over night. The most
surprising thing, the next morningit had no smell. Maybe a faint difficult to describe "Soylent"
smell, but not repulsive like before. It didn't have any taste, although a lifetime of spicy food
brings my taste buds discernibility into question. I had heard people say it had a chalky texture--
they're right. Imagine blending up sticks of sidewalk calk with water. A fine grit suspended in
liquid.

I started using it regularly on Sunday and by Wednesday had figured out a pattern that didn't
exclude real food. I make up half a bag with two bananas and an apple (estimate 1300 calories).
Drink that through the day, then have a normal dinner. The drink is filling, some days I didn't eat
much.

There is a chart of different additives I tried and short opinion of each. I've weighted myself at
irregular intervals (see how unscientific this is going) and couldn't detect any significant gain or
loss--less than 4 pounds difference. I can only guess my caloric intake and burn is unchanged. The
only difference is I don't "eat" a lunch. Presumably this is healthy too.

Speaking of healthy, I had to admit the first few cups of Soylent were strange. One time I had a
tightness in my chest and noticeable increase in heart beat. Another time I felt a little dizzy. I
cannot say with absolute certainty these were caused by Soylent because I've felt these symptoms
before. On the other hand they happened right after consumption. By the third day I felt great. My
theory (or hope) is my body in shock from having healthy food for a change. My regular diet has an
embarrassing Oreo ratio.

The downside to Soylent is I have a number of friends that like to cook and give me flack for my
culinary laziness. Honestly, I kind of enjoy cooking the rare occasion I do it. I could potentially
pursue that as a hobby if the world wasn't full of so many cool things to do. Soylent is a way to
give me time to focus on other hobbies. Breakfast and lunch this week has been no more complicated
than getting another cup of coffee. I lose about 10 minutes every evening making a new batch and
washing the blender.

Soylent fills a need in the market for fast healthy food. Subway used to fill that spot, but they
give so many options now healthy becomes opt-in. The worst part is I came up with a similar idea a
long time ago (to be fair Futurama played a big role in that idea). The only difference is mine was
more like cereal, and it had to taste good with water, milk, or beer.

Short list of things I tried to flavor Soylent with an opinion:

* Two bananas per 1/3 of bag: very banana-y
* Banana, apple, six frozen strawberries per 1/2 bag: not bad
* Banana, apple, lots of frozen strawberries per 1/2 bag: not so good.
* Two bananas, an apple per 1/2 bag: pretty awesome, apple adds a little texture
* One banana, and two apples per 1/2 bag: too much texture
* Two bananas, a pealed apple per 1/2 bag: not worth the effort
* Four double stuffed Oreos per 1/6 bag: expectations where high but not bad (had to be tried--ridiculous amount of calories for the volume)
