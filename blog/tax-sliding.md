----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've done my own taxes every year since 1998 except for 2010, it's fun to me. Follow the
instructions line by line, plug in numbers, do calculations--it's like a program written by the IRS
and I get to execute it. I understand most people don't like it. Taxes are complex and I'm all for
a comprehensive and simplified tax reform. Every year I learn nuances and find the rabbit hole
continues to grow.

As on older college student, I'm around people who are new to income tax. They have two common misconceptions I try to explain.

First, the percent you pay doesn't apply to all taxable income the same. If you make a few extra
dollars and move into the 25% tax bracket, you don't pay 25% on all of it. This is a difficult
concept to explain before 20 a year old loses interest--hence [the program][link1].

Second is the argument for a flat tax rate. I get it, the idea sounds fair--I'm all for fair too,
but what would that rate have to be? Someone has done their homework and figured it out (not me).
I'm not here to debate if it is good or bad, I only want to point out as you earn more you get to
pay more in either scenario. You'll notice on the tax slider page there is an effective tax rate
that will always grow as you pay more. As someone who's stayed in the lower end all his life, I'm
okay with paying more when I have more and keeping more when I have less.

I found it interesting how the tax percentages did not scale evenly. For example you pay 10% on the first $9,225, and 35% on a measly $1,699 when you are nearly at half a million. Seems like this could be excluded all together, making 6 tax brackets instead of the 7.
