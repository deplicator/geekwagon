This might be my last post, [save yourselves][link-1]! It's too late for me. [WildStar][link-2]
comes out in two days and I already know my weekend is ruined. This game is too much fun.

<span style="color: red;">Warning: personal insights that don't</span> [generalize nerds ahead]
[link-3]. I'm also linking to phrases that come from pop/nerd culture that have influenced my way of
thought over the years. It's an experiment to [out the random clutter in my conscience][link-4].

Like many, I want to be productive. I want to be [successful][link-5]. I want to balance between
what is fun and what makes me [those things I said][link-6]. I'm the only one that struggles with
this balance, right?

I get it, there is dopamine in the brain that responds quicker to games. The immediate satisfying
feedback that I did something awesome (those [epic level up lines][link-7] don't help). What bothers
me, is I can feel this way about writing code, or writing creatively, or doing almost anything else.
It just takes longer to get into it the flow, and it's easier to fall out of. I believe [Jane
McGonigal][link-8] is right. If we can make real life feel like playing games we can solve all the
worlds problems.

I hit a good code writing snag and one of two things will happen. It will invigorate me to find the
solution, or it will seem to daunting of a task and make me quit for the day (most code I write is
for my own projects so I have that luxury). In my defense, after a good nights sleep I'll come back
and push through it. I'm almost certain there is a level of complexity versus how tired I am that
determines if I'll push through or quit.

On the other hand games aren't like that. They seem to offer just as much challenge as I need to
keep going. For some reason I'm not deterred when I do meet something challenging. Remember
pre-internet gaming? Someone who reads this post might. It was hard core. I literally walked all
over [Hyrule][link-9] burning every bush and bombing every wall because that's how you found
secretes. Why can't I be that motivated when it comes to coding? Why is it a problem that [doesn't
come up with multiple stackoverflow results][link-10] on a search considered hard? I'm sure
developers in a pre-internet age spent just as much time hammering out problems as I did finding
secretes in video games. Except now they answer those stackoverflow questions for people like me.

I have to wonder how successful I will be if I'm willing to spend the time to find secrets in a
game, but give up when I hit a snag in real life? I take it back I don't wonder, I know. It just
makes me sad when the right answers are staring me in the face, but I will still lose this whole
weekend to gaming on. You know, instead of updating the template for my blog because it's absolutely
horrible.

The struggle for balance continues... In the mean time I will be blowing that balance out my butt by
fighting for the Exiles [right to a decent (virtual?) life][link-11] on Nexus. My only hope is that
I can get it out of my system this weekend, then go back to trying balance again.
