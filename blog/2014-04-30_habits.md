![That sword looks a little too big.][pic-1]

I admit, the primary point of this post is to keep my resolution of one post per month. It seems
like an easy goal; until finals. _Warning: this post contains a bit of personal junk_.

On that note, I find personal productivity (and tracking it) an interesting field. If my RSS reader
is a metric of any kind, there are a lot of people interested in it. It makes sense, we're all
selfish to some extent and personal productivity is all about ourselves.

Some years ago I read [7 Habits of Highly Effective People][link-1]. I'm leery of book titles with
numbers and 'ly' words in the title, but it remains the only book I've ever recommended to others.
It was the book that made me realize I can learn how successful people do things. I still need to
refine it, and practice it, and make it work for me; but I'm not starting from scratch (_note: more
proof we are living in a cool future_).

I don't consider myself a success, but I feel like I'm finally on the right path. Over the years
I've used a number of tools to aid me in being a productive or successful person. I think many of
us struggle with what works for our tastes.

For me, the task managing tool I use most is the one in gmail (you know that one no one knows about
and almost doesn't make sense it's even in there). When I am not at home I can add to it from my
email account. When I am at home I use this link to manage the list.

I don't recall where I found it, or why it exists, or when Google will take it away (RIP Reader). I
like it though. I don't even bother with separate lists, just one big list. For example I'll have
stuff like this:

* COMP3223 - Assignment 3 due
* COMP3053 - Group Project due
* Research Group - Setup bitbucket repo
* Personal - taxes
* Personal - look into dropbox alternatives

I generally group them by what comes before the hyphen, but I can also sort by due date. Tasks can
be edited like one big text document, and you can add notes to a specific task. The only thing
simpler would be a text document (which I've been known to use but it not as satisfying to delete
tasks as it is to check them off and see the line through them).

A couple of weeks ago I started using [habitrpg.com][link-3]. It also has a task list with
satisfying checkboxes, and it's kind of fun. I've particularly enjoyed the daily tasks, I have a bad
habit of skipping breakfast. Since I've started using HabitRPG I have yet to miss breakfast.

Time will tell how well I stick to this one, but so far it is more promising than many of the other
tools I've used. It caters to the gamified desire for immediate feedback. Just the other day I was
so close to level 3, I did a [Project Euler][link-4] problem (which is one of my regular habits)
just to level up.

If this post has a point to make, it is try new stuff. I hear a lot of people say "Have a system and
stick to it." I feel that is bad advice. I say stick with what works, but don't let that stop you
from checking out everything else.
