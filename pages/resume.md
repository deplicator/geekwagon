### Prairie View A&M

### Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Setup a Wiki for internal documentation saving employee's time because it was a fast way to find information and easy to maintain.

### L3 Communications
_Software Development Internship_  
**Summer of 2013**  

Built a user friendly interface to tests the on-board computer of the [Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle][2], making life a little better for some NASA engineers.

### Burgess Specialty Fabricating
_Information Technology Administrator_

Upgraded all clients and virtualized on site servers. Created extensive internal documentation. I was confronted with developing solutions for a variety of unique manufacturing equipment.

### Lone Star University
_Student_  
**2010 - 2011**  

Graduated _summa cum laude_ and I hope they don't take it away for having to look up what it meant.

### Sidtek, L.L.C.
_Head Computer Repair Technician_  
**2003 - 2008**  

My role was to make sure customers were satisfied and the company profited. There was also a lot of troubleshooting involved--ran into many interesting problems. Learned I enjoy helping people more than fixing computers.

### United States Marine Corps
_Sergeant - Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warfare Defense Specialist_  
**1998 - 2003**  

Most of my time was spent in warehouse management and administrative work, but teaching fellow Marines to [survive in contaminated environments][3] was the most rewarding role.
