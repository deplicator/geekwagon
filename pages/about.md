I used to have this crazy idea this page should be coded the hard way with no outside libraries.
That worked well enough, but now it is a place to play with libraries and frameworks. Here are some
in use right now.

* [CMJ.js](https://github.com/cdmedia/cms.js)
* [Milligram](https://milligram.github.io/)

There is a plan to add the projects page back, but in the mean time here are some quick links I use
regularly to show off.

* [xkcd Time at Your Own Pace](http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/)
* [Engines of Our Ingenuity Streamer](http://geekwagon.net/projects/eistreamer/)
* [Ultima VII Party Planner](http://geekwagon.net/projects/u7pp/)
* [2015 Tax Slider](http://deplicator.github.io/tax-slider/)
* [Sudoku Experiment](http://geekwagon.net/projects/sudoku/)
* [Tetris Clone](http://geekwagon.net/projects/flipsy/)

* [older blog posts](http://blog.geekwagon.net/)
